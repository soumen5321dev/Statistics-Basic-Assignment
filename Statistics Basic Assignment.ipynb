    "1. Nominal Level\n",
    "Concept:\n",
    "The nominal level of measurement classifies data into distinct categories that do not have any intrinsic order or\n",

    "Variable: Types of Fruits\n",

    "3. Interval Level\n",
    "Concept:\n",
    "The interval level of measurement not only ranks data in a meaningful order but also has equal intervals between\n",

    "Incorrect Approach: Calculating the mean satisfaction score (e.g., 3.6) is not appropriate because the intervals\n",

    "Correct Approach: Using the median or mode to summarize the central tendency of ordinal data. The median rating\n",
